# Comp123-003 - Summer 2019

This repository contains C# Visual Studio Solutions for Comp123-003 class.

How did I get all these Visual Studio Projects on only one GitHub repository?
  - On my disk I have a folder (ClassCode) wich contain others sub-folders, one for each "solution".
  - From command prompt, go to that folder.
  - Start git with this command: "git init" (This will create a local git repo).
  - Put the file .gitignore there.
  - On TeamExplorer home, commit to local repo using "Changes" option.
  - On TeamExplorer home, sync to remote GitHub repository 
  - DONE!
